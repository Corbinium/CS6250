Run all the code below and you'll be good to go.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv             # create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate         # run venv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # install packages
python3 -i operators.py          # run system
```

If you don't want something to be added to the repo, like say you algorithm, just name it `alg_*.py`.
